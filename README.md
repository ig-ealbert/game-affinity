# Game Affinity

## Overview

This is a quick and fun survey to provide newcomers to video gaming with some genre suggestions.

I had a couple of people recently explain that they'd like to get into at least one video game soon, but don't know where to start. Problem solved!

## Setup

This setup assumes you have `git` and `npm` installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/ig-ealbert/game-affinity.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Creation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

I disabled tailwind's preflight because it removes the regular HTML formatting for things like headers and lists, which I use in this project.
